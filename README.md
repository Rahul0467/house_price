# house_price
I have build a model using sklearn for banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. During model building I have performed data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
